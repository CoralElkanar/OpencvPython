## Introduction

Computer vision is a fascinating field with countless real-world applications, and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) empowers us to delve into this exciting realm. 
With a strong focus on practical implementation, this repository chronicles my exploration of OpenCV's capabilities, from the fundamentals to creating captivating projects.

## Projects

1. **Chapter 1: Getting Started**
   - Introduction to OpenCV and basic image operations - read and display images, videos and webcam.

2. **Chapter 2: Image and Video Processing**
   - Manipulate and filter images and videos - convert to grayscale, blur, Canny (edge detectoe).

3. **Chapter 3: Image Transformation**
   - Resize and crop images.

4. **Chapter 4: Drawing on Images**
   - Add shapes, lines, and text to enhance visual content.

5. **Chapter 5: Contours and Shape Detection**
   - Explore contour detection and shape recognition techniques.

6. **Chapter 6: Face Detection**
   - Detect faces in images and video streams.

7. **Chapter 7: Color Detection**
   - Develop color - based object detection algorithms.

8. **Chapter 8: Warp Perspective**
   - Correct perspective and perform image warping.

9. **Chapter 9: Face Detection**
   - Detect faces from images - uses face CascadeClassifier from opencv library.

10. **Virtual Paint Project**
   - Paint virtually on video frames, combining color detection and drawing.

## Learning Source

My journey into OpenCV has been inspired by a comprehensive YouTube course [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs&t=345s]. The source video provides practical insights and hands-on guidance.
This course has enabled me to develop a valuable skill set for computer vision.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized into chapters, corresponding to the projects and exercises covered in my OpenCV learning journey. 
Each chapter contains detailed documentation to the code.

I invite you to explore these projects, learn from them, and even contribute your own ideas and improvements. 
Together, we can create a vibrant community of OpenCV enthusiasts.
